It started with a thesis crisis. 
      
I was a final-year Architecture student, fueled entirely by panic and cheap espresso. It was 3:15 AM on a Tuesday, and I was sitting in The Greasy Spoon, a 24-hour diner that smelled permanently of bacon grease and despair. I was surrounded by a fortress of textbooks on Brutalism and urban decay. 
      
The bell above the door jingled, and a guy walked in. He looked exactly how I felt: completely drained. He was wearing an oversized hoodie with the hood pulled up, generic jeans, and he kept his head down, avoiding eye contact with the sleepy waitress.
      
He sat three booths away, ordered a vanilla milkshake, and stared at his phone like it was a bomb he was trying to defuse. 
      
Ten minutes later, disaster struck. My screen dimmed. My laptop charger had died.
      
I scrambled under the table, checking the outlet. Dead. I looked around frantically. The diner was empty except for me, the sleeping waitress, and Hood Guy. And, of course, the only working outlet with a green light was directly under his table. 
      
I took a deep breath, grabbed my plug, and marched over. 
      
"I am so sorry," I said, crouching near his booth, holding my plug up like a peace offering. "Do you mind? If my laptop dies, I’ll fail my major, and I’ll have to live in this diner’s crappy flat forever."
      
He looked up. 
      
The first thing I noticed were his eyes. They were piercing blue, startlingly awake compared to the rest of him. He blinked, looking at me, then at the plug, then back at me. He shrugged.
      
"Go ahead," he said. His voice was raspy. "I don't want you to live here. The food is bad." 
      
His accent was hard to place—definite European, blunt, a little hoarse. 
      
"I’m Eleanor," I said, diving under his table to plug it in. "You can call me Ell." 
      
"Franz," he replied. 
      
I emerged from under the table and sat opposite him, just for a second, to make sure the charge was holding. "Thanks, Franz. You're a lifesaver. You studying too?"
      
"No," he said, stirring his milkshake. "Just... escaping." 
      
"Work?" 
      
"Something like that." 
      
We ended up talking until 5 AM. Not about work, initially. I complained about the cost of heating my drafty student house and the structural impossibility of my roommate Noah’s lasagna. He listened with a strange intensity, as if my complaints about utility bills were the most fascinating thing he’d heard all week.
      
He complained about "travel fatigue." 
      
"I miss my cats," he said suddenly, showing me a picture on his phone. They were Bengal cats. They looked expensive. 
      
"They're cute," I said. "So, what do you do? That keeps you away from the cats?" 
      
He hesitated. Just for a fraction of a second. 

"Logistics," he said. "High-performance logistics." 

"Like... Amazon?" 

"No," he cracked a small smile. "Faster. Moving sensitive cargo across borders. Strict deadlines. If I am late, people get very angry. It is... high pressure." 

"Sounds intense," I yawned, packing up my books. "Well, Max from Logistics, thanks for the electricity." 

I thought he was a truck driver, or maybe a shift manager for a shipping company. I didn't ask. I just liked that he didn't ask me for anything. He didn't ask for my number, he didn't ask what I was doing later. He just drank his milkshake and let me vent. Well, eventually he did ask for my number, which I gave him, you know incase things get a bit serious.
