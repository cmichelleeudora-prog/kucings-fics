Three months later, Franz had become a fixture in my life. A weird, intermittent fixture.
      
He traveled constantly. He’d disappear for four days to "Italy" or "Japan" or "Miami" for work, texting me complaints about customs and jet lag. Then, he’d reappear in London, showing up at my student house with expensive takeout and a desperate need to sit on my lumpy sofa and do absolutely nothing. 
      
My roommate, Noah, was skeptical at first. Noah is a Mechanical Engineering student who spent his spare time taking appliances apart and failing to put them back together. 
      
It was a Sunday afternoon. It was raining. Franz was lying on the floor of our living room, staring at the ceiling. I was typing furiously at the table. Noah was surrounded by papers, looking like he was about to cry. 
      
"I don't get it," Noah groaned, slamming his pencil down. "The drag coefficient on this theoretical model is impossible. If I increase the angle of attack here, the turbulence destroys the rear stability." 
      
Franz didn't move, but I saw his eyes shift. 
      
"What are you working on?" Franz asked. 
      
"Aerodynamics assignment," Noah grumbled. "Designing a wing for a high-speed vehicle. But the airflow separation is a nightmare." 
      
Franz sat up. He crawled over to where Noah was sitting and looked at the diagram. 
      
"Your endplate is too simple," Max said bluntly. 
      
Noah blinked. "Excuse me?" 
      
"The air," Franz gestured with his hands, making swooping motions. "You are trying to force it over the top. You need to wash it out. Push the dirty air away from the body, or you lose the... the grip at the back." 
      
Noah frowned, adjusting his glasses. "Mate, you work in logistics. You move boxes. This is bosh." 
      
"I move fast boxes," Max said, his face dead serious. "And I know that if you put the angle like this, the car—I mean, the vehicle—will spin." 
      
"It's fluid dynamics, mate," Noah said condescendingly. "It's math. Not packing tape." 
      
"The math is wrong," Max insisted. He grabbed Noah's pencil. "Look. You need a vortex generator here. To seal the floor." 
      
"Seal the floor?" Noah laughed. "What are you talking about? It's a wing, not a vacuum cleaner." 
      
I watched them from the table. Franz looked frustrated. His hand was shaking slightly, hovering over the paper like he wanted to redraw the whole thing. He looked like he was physically restraining himself from giving a lecture. 
      
"Just trust me," Franz muttered, dropping the pencil. "Flatten the angle. Open the side. It will work." 
      
"Right," Noah said, rolling his eyes. "I'll take advice from the guy who didn't know how to use the toaster last week." 
      
Franz slumped back against the sofa, crossing his arms. "Fine. Crash. See if I care." 
      
"Nobody is crashing, mate. It's a diagram." 
      
Two weeks later, the crash actually happened. But not to Noah’s diagram. 
      
It was a Sunday, and our house was plunged into the dark ages because the WiFi router had finally given up the ghost. 
      
"Fix it," I told Noah. 
      
"I can’t," Noah said, lying on the floor. "It’s a hardware issue. The silicon soul has left the casing. We have to go out." 
      
I had a 5,000-word chapter due on Monday morning. So, against my better judgment, we packed our bags and trudged down to The King’s Head, the only pub within walking distance that didn't smell entirely of mildew and had free WiFi. 
      
The pub was packed. I managed to secure a sticky corner table while Noah went to get drinks. I put my noise-canceling headphones on, opened my laptop, and tried to ignore the fact that the entire room was screaming at the television screens mounted on the walls. 
      
"Ell," Noah said, sliding a coke across the table. He didn't sit down. He was standing, staring over my head at the screen behind me. 
      
"I am working, Noah. Do not disturb the genius." 
      
"Ell," he said again. His voice was weird. Strained. "Look at the TV." 
      
"I don't care about football." 
      
"It’s not football. It’s... motor racing. I think." 
      
"Good for them. Do they drive in circles?" I typed a sentence about urban density. 
      
"Ell, please." Noah grabbed my shoulder. "Just look. Tell me I’m crazy. Tell me that isn't who I think it is." 
      
I sighed, ripped my headphones off, and spun around in my chair. 
      
The screen was massive. It was showing a podium ceremony. Confetti was raining down. The Dutch national anthem was blaring out of the pub speakers. 
      
Standing on the top step of the podium, holding a gold trophy that was roughly the size of a small child, was a man in a blue racing suit. He was drenched in sweat and champagne. He was grinning, waving at a crowd of thousands. 
      
I squinted. 
      
The camera zoomed in on his face. The piercing blue eyes. The nose. The slight sunburn on his cheeks that he always complained about getting. 

The man on the screen laughed and sprayed champagne over the guy standing next to him. 
      
I felt the blood drain out of my body. The noise of the pub faded into a dull roar. 
      
"That’s him isn’t it ? The logistics guy," Noah whispered. 
      
"It can't be," I said, my voice trembling. "Max is... Max is in France. Moving crates. He texted me this morning about a delayed lorry." 
      
"That is Franz, or atleast he was, you know what this means, right ell ? That logistics guy had been lying to us !" Noah said, pointing a shaking finger at the screen. The chyron beneath the man’s face flashed in bold white letters: 
      
MAX VERSTAPPEN - WINNER - MONACO GRAND PRIX 
      
"Verstappen?" I read the name out loud. It felt foreign. Heavy.  My jaw clenches, so did my fingers.
      
"He’s not a logistics manager," Noah said, his voice rising in hysteria. "Ell. He’s an F1 driver. He’s... he’s the guy I told lectured about not knowing mechanics." Noah grabbed his hair. "I explained aerodynamics to Max Verstappen. Oh my god. I need a drink. I need a stronger drink." 
      
I didn't move. I stared at the screen as Max—my Max, the guy who wore holes in his socks and ate my yogurt—hoisted the trophy high above his head. He looked like a god. He looked untouchable. 
      
And he looked like the biggest liar in the history of the universe. 
      
I slowly closed my laptop. 
      
"Noah," I said, my voice deadly calm. "Let’s go back home, I’ve got a logistics manager to kill with a scale ruler.”
